# freezeyt

Static web page generator created by the Czech Python community.


## What this does

Freezeyt is a static webpage *freezer*.
It takes a Python web application and turns it into a set of files
that can be served by a simple server like [GitHub Pages] or
Python's [http.server].

[GitHub Pages]: https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/working-with-github-pages/about-github-pages
[http.server]: https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.server.html

Freezeyt is compatible with all Python web frameworks that use the common
[Web Server Gatweay Interface] (WSGI)

[Web Server Gatweay Interface]: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3333/


## Installation

Freezeyt requires Python 3.6 or above.

It is highly recommended to create and activate a separate virtual
environment for this project.
You can use [`venv`], `virtualenv`, Conda, containers or any other kind
of virtual environment.

[`venv`]: https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html?highlight=venv#module-venv

The tool can be installed using:

```
$ python -m pip install .
```


## Usage

To use freezeyt, you need a Python web application.
You can use the [example Flask app].

[example Flask app]: https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/quickstart/

Your WSGI application should be named `app`.
Both the application and Freezeyt must be importable (installed)
in your environment.

Run freezeyt with the name of your application and the
output directory. For example:

```shell
$ python -m freezeyt my_app _build
```

Freezeyt may overwrite the build directory (here, `_build`),
removing all existing files from it.

For more options, see Configuration below.


### Python API

Freezeyt also has a Python API, the `freeze` function
that takes an application to freeze and a configuration dict:

```python
from freezeyt import freeze
freeze(app, config)
```

The `config` should be a dict as if read from a YAML configuration
file (see Configuration below).


## Configuration

While common options can be given on the command line,
you can have full control over the freezing process with a YAML
configuration file or a variable with the configuration.
You can specify a config file using the `-c/--config` option,
for example:

```shell
$ python -m freezeyt my_app _build -c freezeyt.yaml
```

The configuration variable should be a dictionary.
To pass the config variable, use the `-C/--import-config` option,
for example:

```shell
$ python -m freezeyt my_app _build -C my_app:freezeyt_config
```

The following options are configurable:

### Module Name

The module that contains the application must be given on the
command line.
In it, Freezyt looks for the variable `app`.
A different variable can be specified using `:`.

Examples:

    application
or

    folder1.folder2.application
or

    my_app:wsgi_application


### Output

To outupt the frozen website to a directory, specify
the directory name:

```yaml
output: ./_build/
```

Or use the full form – using the `dir` *saver*:

```yaml
output:
    type: dir
    dir: ./_build/
```

If output is not specified in the configuration file,
you must specify the oputput directory on the command line.
Specifying it both on the command line and in the config file
is an error.

If there is any existing content in the output directory,
freezeyt will either remove it (if the content looks like a previously
frozen website) or raise an error.
Best practice is to remove the output directory before freezing.



#### Output to dict

For testing, Freezeyt can also output to a dictionary.
This can be configured with:

```yaml
output:
    type: dict
```

This is not useful in the CLI, as the return value is lost.


### Prefix

The URL where the application will be deployed can be
specified with:

```yaml
prefix: http://localhost:8000/
```
or
```yaml
prefix: https://mysite.example.com/subpage/
```

Freezeyt will freeze all pages starting with `prefix` that
it finds.

The prefix can also be specified on thecommand line with e.g.:
`--prefix=http://localhost:8000/`.
The CLI argument has priority over the config file.

### Extra pages

A list of URLs to “extra” pages within the application can
be given using:
```yaml
extra_pages:
    - /extra/
    - /extra2.html
```

Freezeyt will freeze these pages in addition to those it
finds by following links.

Extra pages may also be give on the command line,
e.g. `--extra-page /extra/ --extra-page /extra2.html`.
The lists from CLI and the config file are merged together.

You can also specify extra pages using a Python generator,
specified using a module name and function name as follows:

```yaml
extra_pages:
    - generator: my_app:generate_extra_pages
```

The `generate_extra_pages` function should take the application
as argument and return an iterable of URLs.

When using the Python API, a generator for extra pages can be specified
directly as a Python object, for example:

```python
config = {
   ...
   'extra_pages': [{'generator': my_generator_function}],
}
another_config = {
   ...
   'extra_pages': [my_generator_function],
}
```


### Extra files

Extra files to be included in the output can be specified,
along with their content.

This is useful for configuration of your static server.
(For pages that are part of your website, we recommend
adding them to your application rather than as extra files.)

For example, the following config will add 3 files to
the output:

```yaml
extra_files:
      CNAME: mysite.example.com
      ".nojekyll": ''
      config/xyz: abc
```

You can also specify extra files using Base64 encoding or
a file path, like so:


```yaml
extra_files:
    config.dat:
        base64: "YWJjZAASNA=="
    config2.dat:
        copy_from: included/config2.dat
```

Extra files cannot be specified on the CLI.


### Default MIME type

Freezeyt checks whether the file extensions in its output
correspond to the MIME types served by the app.
If there's a mismatch, freezeyt fails, because this means a server
wouldn't be able to serve the page correctly.

It is possible to specify the MIME type used for files without an extension.
For example, if your server of static pages defaults to plain text files,
use:

```yaml
default_mimetype=text/plain
```


### Hooks

It is possible to register *hooks*, functions that are called when
specific events happen in the freezing process.

For example, if `mymodule` defines functions `start` and `page_frozen`,
you can make freezeyt call them using this configuration:

```yaml
hooks:
    start:
        mymodule:start
    page_frozen:
        mymodule:page_frozen
```

When using the Python API, a function can be used instead of a name
like `mymodule:start`.

#### `start`

The function will be called when the freezing process starts,
before any other hooks.

It is passed a `FreezeInfo` object as argument.
The object has the following method:

* `add_url(url)`: Add the URL to the set of pages to be frozen.
  If that URL was frozen already, or is outside the `prefix`, does nothing.

#### `page_frozen`

The function will be called whenever a page is saved.
It is passed a `TaskInfo` object as argument.
The object has the following attributes:

* `get_a_url()`: returns a URL of the page, including `prefix`.
  Note that a page may be reachable via several URLs; this function returns
  an arbitrary one.
* `path`: the relative path the content is saved to.
* `freeze_info`: a `FreezeInfo` object. See the `start` hook for details.


### Redirect policy

The `redirect_policy` option specifies the policy for handling redirects.
It can be:
* `'error'` (default): When a redirect response is encountered,
  `freezeyt` will abort.
* `'save'`: `freezeyt` will save the body of the redirect page, as if
  the response was `200`.
  This is meant to be used with redirects in the HTML `<meta>` tag.
* `'follow'`: `freezeyt` will save content from the redirected location.
* `'ignore'`: `freezeyt` will not save any content for pages that redirect.

For example:

```yaml
redirect_policy: save
```


### URL finding

`freezeyt` discovers pages in the application it freezes by scanning
the application's pages for links.
By default, HTML and CSS pages are scanned this way.
It is possible to customize the scanning or turn it off by setting
`url_finders` in the configuration.
For example, the default scanners would be specified as:

```yaml
url_finders:
    text/html: get_html_links
    text/css: get_css_links
```

Keys in the `url_finders` dict are MIME types; the values can be:
* strings in the form `"module:function"`, which name the scanning
  function to call,
* strings like `get_html_links`, which name a function from the
  `freezeyt.url_finders` module, or
* Python functions (if configuring `freezeyt` from Python rather than
  YAML).

A scanning function gets these arguments:
* an open file with the page's contents (call `read` to get the contents
  as bytes),
* the URL of the page, as a string, and
* the HTTP headers, as a list of (name, value) tuples (as in WSGI).

The function should return an iterator of URLs (as strings) found
in the page's contents.

The `freezeyt.url_finders` module includes the functions `get_html_links`
and `get_css_links`, which you can call (for example, as fallbacks).


### Path generation

It is possible to customize the filenames that URLs are saved under
using the `path_to_url` configuration key, for example:

```yaml
path_to_url: my_module:path_to_url
```

The value can be:
* a strings in the form `"module:function"`, which names the
  function to call (the function can be omitted along with the colon,
  and defaults to `url_to_path`), or
* a Python function (if configuring `freezeyt` from Python rather than
  YAML).

The function receives the *path* of the URL to save, relative to the `prefix`,
and should return a path to the saved file, relative to the build directory.

The default function, available as `freezeyt.url_to_path`, adds `index.html`
if the URL path ends with `/`.


## Examples of CLI usage

```shell
$ python -m freezeyt my_app _build/
```

```shell
$ python -m freezeyt my_app _build/ --prefix https://pyladies.cz/
```

```shell
$ python -m freezeyt my_app _build/ -c config.yaml
```

```shell
$ python -m freezeyt my_app _build/ --prefix https://pyladies.cz/ --extra-page /extra1/ --extra-page /extra2/
```

```shell
$ python -m freezeyt my_app _build/ --prefix https://pyladies.cz/ --extra-page /extra1/ --extra-page /extra2/ --config path/to/config.yaml
```

### Using an in-development copy of freezeyt

* Set `PYTHONPATH` to the directory with `freezeyt`, for example:
  * Unix: `export PYTHONPATH="/home/name/freezeyt"`
  * Windows: `set PYTHONPATH=C:\Users\Name\freezeyt`

* Install the web application you want to freeze. Either:
  * install the application using `pip`, if possible, or
  * install the application's dependencies and `cd` to the app's directory.

* Run freezeyt, for example:
  * `python -m freezeyt demo_app_url_for _build --prefix http://freezeyt.test/foo/`



### Tests

For testing the project it's necessary to install additional requirements:

```
$ python -m pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

To run tests in your current environment, use pytest:

```
$ python -m pytest
```

To run tests with multiple Python versions (if you have them installed),
install `tox` using `python -m pip install tox` and run it:

```
$ tox
```

#### Environ variables for tests

Some test scenarios compare freezeyt's results with expected output.
When the files with expected output don't exist yet,
they can be created by setting the environment variable
`TEST_CREATE_EXPECTED_OUTPUT` to `1`:

**Unix**

```shell
$ export TEST_CREATE_EXPECTED_OUTPUT=1
```

**Windows**

```shell
> set TEST_CREATE_EXPECTED_OUTPUT=1
```

If you set the variable to any different value or leave it unset
then the files will not be recreated
(tests will fail if the files are not up to date).

When output changes, you need to first delete the expected output,
regenerate it by running tests with `TEST_CREATE_EXPECTED_OUTPUT=1`,
and check that the difference is correct.

### Freezeyt Blog

We keep a blog about the development of Freezeyt.
It is available [here](https://encukou.github.io/freezeyt/).

**Be warned:** some of it is in the Czech language.

#### Blog development

The blog was tested on Python version 3.8.

The blog is a Flask application.
To run it, install additional dependecies mentioned in
`requirements-blog.txt`.
Then, set the environment variable `FLASK_APP` to the path of the
blog app.
Also set `FLASK_ENV` to "development" for easier debugging.
Then, run the Flask server.

1. On Microsoft Windows:

```shell
> python -m pip install -r requirements-blog.txt
> set FLASK_APP=freezeyt_blog/app.py
> set FLASK_ENV=development
> flask run
```

2. On UNIX:

```shell
$ python -m pip install -r requirements-blog.txt
$ export FLASK_APP=freezeyt_blog/app.py
$ export FLASK_ENV=development
$ flask run
```

The URL where your blog is running will be printed on the terminal.

Once you're satisfied with how the blog looks, you can freeze it with:

```shell
$ python -m freezeyt freezeyt_blog.app freezeyt_blog/build
```

#### Adding new articles to freezeyt blog

Articles are writen in the `Markdown` language.

**Article** - save to directory `../freezeyt/freezeyt_blog/articles`

**Images to articles** - save to directory `../freezeyt/freezeyt_blog/static/images`

If te files are saved elsewhere, the blog will not work correctly.


## History

### Why did the project start?

The Czech Python community uses a lot of static web pages that
are generated from a web application for community purposes.
For example, organizing and announcing workshops, courses,
or meetups.

The community has been so far relying on [Frozen Flask] and [elsa]
in order to generate the static web content.
The new [freezer] ought to be used with any arbitrary Python Web
application framework ([Flask], [Django], [Tornado], etc.).
So the community won't be limited by one web app technology for
generating static pages anymore.
