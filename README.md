# freezeyt
Generator of static web pages created by the Czech Python community.


## Project goal
Main goal of this project is to create a versatile freezer to generate static web pages from web application. The freezer aims to be compatible with any Python Web framework.


## What IS the project about?
The idea is to create a new freezer in order to generate static web pages. It should also help the czech beginner pythonistas who've already taken their first steps with the Python programming language and now they are looking for some real projects where they could not only put their programming skills to the test but also to improve them.


### What the project IS NOT about?
I have no idea so far.


## Installation
It is highly recommended to create a separate virtual environment for this project:
```
$ python -m venv venv
```

All needed requirements can be installed to an activated virtual environment using this command:
```
$ python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```


### Installation for testing project

For testing the project it's necessary to install pytest and flask:
```
$ python -m pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

To run tests, use pytest:

```
$ python -m pytest
```

To run tests with multiple Python versions (if you have them installed),
install `tox` using `python -m pip install tox` and tun it:

```
$ tox
```


### Installation for blog site

It's necessary to install all dependecies mentioned in `requirements-blog.txt`:

```shell
$ python -m pip install -r requirements-blog.txt
```


## Usage

### How to use static web site generator freezeyt

* Set `PYTHONPATH` to the directory with `freezeyt`, for example:
  * Unix: `export PYTHONPATH="/home/name/freezeyt"`
  * Windows: `set PYTHONPATH=C:\Users\Name\freezeyt`

* Install the web application you want to freeze. Either:
  * install the application using `pip`, if possible, or
  * install the application's dependencies and `cd` to the app's directory.

* Run freezeyt, for example:
  * `python -m freezeyt demo_app_url_for _build --prefix http://freezeyt.test/foo/`


### How to use freezeyt-blog

Blog was tested on Python version 3.8.

To run the blog on your local machine, set the environment variable `FLASK_APP` to the path of the blog app.
Also set `FLASK_ENV` to "development" for easier debugging.
Then, run the Flask server.

1. On Microsoft Windows:

```shell
> set FLASK_APP=freezeyt_blog/app.py
> set FLASK_ENV=development
> flask run
```

2. On UNIX:

```shell
$ export FLASK_APP=freezeyt_blog/app.py
$ export FLASK_ENV=development
$ flask run
```

The URL where your blog is running will be printed on the terminal.


#### How to add new articles to freezeyt blog

Articles are writen in the `Markdown` language.

**Article** - save to directory `../freezeyt/freezeyt_blog/articles`

**Images to articles** - save to directory `../freezeyt/freezeyt_blog/static/images`

If te files are saved elsewhere, the blog will not work correctly.


## Contributing
Are you interested in this project? Awesome! Anyone who wants to be part of this project and who's willing to help us is very welcome.
Only started with Python? Good news! We're trying to target mainly the beginner Pythonistas who are seeking opportunities to contribute to (ideally open source) projects and who would like to be part of an open source community which could give them a head start in their (hopefully open source :)) programming careers.
Soo, what if I already have some solid Python-fu? First, there's always something new to learn, and second, we'd appreciate if you could guide the "rookies" and pass on some of the knowledge onto them.


Contributions, issues and feature requests are welcome.

### How to contribute

1. Just clone this repository to your local computer:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/encukou/freezeyt
```

2. Then fork this repo to your GitHub account
3. Add your forked repo as a new remote to your local computer:
```
$ git remote add <name_your_remote> https://github.com/<your_username>/freezeyt
```
4. Create new branch at your local computer
```
$ git branch <name_new_branch>
```
5. Switch to your new branch
```
$ git switch <name_new_branch>
```
6. Make some awesome changes in code
7. Push changes to your forked repo on GitHub

```
$ git push <your_remote> <your_new_branch>
```
8. Finally make a pull request from your GitHub account to origin
9. Repeat this process until we will have done amazing freezer


### Used tools

* [PEP 3333 - Python WSGI](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3333/)
* [flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/)
* [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/)
* [html5lib](https://html5lib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)


### Why did the project start?

The Czech Python community uses a lot of static web pages that are generated from a web application for community purposes e.g. workshops, courses, or meetups.

The community has been so far relying on the following projects ([flask-frozen](https://pythonhosted.org/Frozen-Flask/) and [elsa](https://github.com/pyvec/elsa/)) in order to generate the static web content. The new [freezer](https://github.com/encukou/freezeyt) ought to be used with any arbitrary Python Web application framework ([Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/), [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), [Tornado](https://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/), etc.). So the community won't be limited by one web app technology for generating static pages anymore.
